# 100 days of code challenge.

 ## The Idea


I saw an account doing this here on GitHub
, and since I don't have much confidence in 
coding and its logical aspects, I decided to 
join the challenge. My plan is to pratice
 simple exercises every day. Besides, every 10 
days that goes by, I will tackle
 something more challenging, 
such as a small and simple project. 
Additionally, to stay motivated, I stream
 my coding sessions and exercises on Twitch.

Here's the link in case you want to watch it (it is mainly portuguese).
